<h1>Description</h1>
<ul>
<li>Responsive and Interactive User Interface: The combination of React with SCSS ensures that the website is not only visually appealing but also highly responsive and interactive. The dynamic capabilities of React, coupled with the powerful styling features of SCSS, provide a seamless user experience across devices.</li>
  
<li>Maintainability and Scalability: The use of TypeScript adds a layer of type safety, making the codebase more maintainable and less prone to errors as the website grows. The modular approach in both React and SCSS further contributes to the scalability of the project.</li>

<li>Modern Development Practices: This stack represents modern web development practices, focusing on performance, developer experience, and maintainability. The use of React, TypeScript, and SCSS ensures that the website is built on a solid foundation, capable of adapting to future needs and requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>In this project, I used the following technologies:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>HTML: Provides the skeleton of the application, such as the div containers and basic tags for where the To-Do app will be rendered.</li>
  <li>CSS: Defines how the elements like buttons, input fields, and to-do list items look</li>
  <li>React: Handles state, reactivity, and user interface components such as adding or removing to-dos, displaying the list, and updating the UI efficiently.</li>
  <li>Typescript: Improves code maintainability and scalability by defining types for the data structures</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to run project locally:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone repository using Git</li>
  <li>Open your terminal</li>
  <li>Install the standard package manager for Node.js using <b>npm i</b></li>
  <li>Type <b>npm start</b> to run project locally.</li>
</ol>
